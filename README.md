This ML model takes a dataset which is the house prices of the city of Bengaluru. The dataset contains the details about the houses, i.e., Locality, Number of rooms, Bathrooms, Area in sqft, Availibility of house, Balcony and so on. Depending upon all these factors I create a Regression model which takes in several parameters and then gives us the predicted price of a house seeing the details of it.
